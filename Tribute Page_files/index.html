<p>Fame is but a fruit tree</p>
<p>So very unsound</p>
<p>It can never flourish</p>
<p>Till its stalk is in the ground</p>
<p>So men of fame</p>
<p>Can never find a way</p>
<p>Till time has flown</p>
<p>Far from their dying day</p>
<p>Forgotten while you're here</p>
<p>Remembered for a while</p>
<p>A much updated rain</p>
<p>From a much updated style</p>
<p>Life is but a memory</p>
<p>Happened long ago</p>
<p>Theatre full of sadness</p>
<p>For a long forgotten show</p>
<p>Seems so easy</p>
<p>Just to let it go on by</p>
<p>Till you stop and wonder</p>
<p>Why you never wondered why</p>
<p>Safe in a womb of an everlasting night</p>
<p>You find the darkness can give the brightest light</p>
<p>Safe in your place deep in the earth</p>
<p>That's when they'll know</p>
<p>What you are really worth</p>
<p>Forgotten while you're here</p>
<p>Remembered for a while</p>
<p>A much updated rain</p>
<p>From a much updated style</p>
<p>Fame is but a fruit tree</p>
<p>So very unsound</p>
<p>It can never flourish</p>
<p>Till its stalk is in the ground</p>
<p>So men of fame can never find a way</p>
<p>Till time has flown far from their dying day</p>
<p>Fruit tree</p>
<p>Fruit tree</p>
<p>No one knows you but the rain and the air</p>
<p>Don't you worry</p>
<p>They'll stand and stare when you're gone</p>
<p>Fruit tree</p>
<p>Fruit tree</p>
<p>Open your eyes to another year</p>
<p>They will know that you were here</p>
<p>when you are gone</p>
